# ⚡Exploring World Database in SQL⚡

As part of the JustIT data bootcamp we have been assigned some projects to demonstrate our understanding of the applications and our abilities in exploring datasets using these applications.

For this assignment we were given the 'World Database' in SQL and a series of prompts of how to explore the dataset using SQL queries.

This was an excellent exercise in data exploration and utilising all of the queried we had learned. 

Below is an example of an SQL query which was used to find the number of cities from the United States which are included in this database:
