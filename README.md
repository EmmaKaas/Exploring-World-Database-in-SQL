Exploring World Database in SQL

As part of the JustIT data bootcamp we have been assigned some projects to demonstrate our understanding of the applications and our abilities in exploring datasets using these applications.

For this assignment we were given the 'World Database' in SQL and a series of prompts of what we should try and find in the dataset using SQL queries.

This was an excellent exercise in data exploration and utilising all of the queried we had learned. 

Feel free to have a look over the attached project detailing my process for more information!
